# How to Contribute : Metadata

Metadata are additional names given to different elements of the game, that are not present in the original game's data files.

We need metadata because:
 * It makes understanding the game's scripts easier
 * It helps us implement script commands better
 * It's an important step towards scripts _modding_
 
## How to edit metadata
 
 1. Fire up the online [editor](http://lba2remake.xesf.net/#editor=true) and start a game.
 2. Close the editor areas you don't need (`Scripts` and `Debug HUD`):
