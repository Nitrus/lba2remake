# How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to the project, there are several ways you can help.
Any kind of contribution is very much welcome, you don't necessarily need to know how to write code.

We'd like to get in touch with you over [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lba2remake/shared_invite/enQtMzIyNzIwNDMzNTIxLTc5OGVkNjI3NGE4YjM5ZTE5YmRkODBjMzNjOTk5NGM1NGIyMTI2N2FlOTYzYjBlZjE4NzIzYWI3ZWI0YmViMmI) if you plan on giving us a hand, we can provide directions to help you get started.


## Contributing without writing code

### Completing the metadata

We are building a list of actor, zone, checkpoint and variable names for the game scenes.

It is not required to be a programmer to help. You can do it right in the [editor](http://lba2remake.xesf.net/#editor=true).

For more details, check [how to contribute metadata](doc/how_to_metadata.md).

### Reporting crashes and bugs

You can try to make the [game](http://lba2remake.xesf.net/) or the [editor](http://lba2remake.xesf.net/#editor=true) crash, and use the `Send crash report` button to inform us of what needs fixing.

If you observe a bug you can report it [here](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/issues/new).

### Propose features

If you have an idea that is not already listed there, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/issues/new) to suggest a new feature.

You can also discuss and vote for the various [proposed evolutions](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5Ba%5D+PROPOSAL%22) to the project.


## Contributing as a developer

The best way to start contributing as a developer is to get in touch with us over [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/lba2remake/shared_invite/enQtMzIyNzIwNDMzNTIxLTc5OGVkNjI3NGE4YjM5ZTE5YmRkODBjMzNjOTk5NGM1NGIyMTI2N2FlOTYzYjBlZjE4NzIzYWI3ZWI0YmViMmI) and tell us what you'd like to do with the project so we can point you in the right direction.

Or you can fork the project and work on whatever you want!

### Architecture

`[TODO]` We're working to document our architecture, design choices and engineering principles, as well as giving pointers on how to get started hacking the code.

### Find an issue to work on

You can find a list of [milestones](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/milestones) and a description of what we want to do with them in the [readme](README.md).

We also have [projects](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/projects) describing or current plans (short and mid-term).
